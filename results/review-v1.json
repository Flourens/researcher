  "executiveSummary": "BUILDGEN-UA is an exceptionally well-crafted proposal that demonstrates deep understanding of both the technical challenge and the grant requirements. The proposal presents a compelling case for developing a domain-specific generative AI system for Ukrainian construction cost estimation, combining a fine-tuned LLM with a sophisticated RAG architecture. The writing is precise, the methodology is rigorous with clear ablation studies and baselines, the work plan is realistic and well-structured, and the impact narrative convincingly connects technical outputs to business value and broader societal needs (Ukraine reconstruction). The proposal addresses virtually all mandatory requirements of the FFplus Call-2-Type-2 with thoroughness that should score highly across all three evaluation criteria.\n\nThe primary strengths lie in the crystal-clear justification for why existing models cannot solve this problem, the detailed technical architecture with specific hyperparameters and training configurations, the comprehensive evaluation framework with six baseline comparisons, and the persuasive commercial exploitation pathway. The proposal also excels in its trustworthy AI risk assessment and data management plan, both of which are well-integrated rather than appearing as afterthoughts.\n\nThe main areas for improvement are: (1) the eligibility of the Zaporizhzhia-based partners needs careful verification given Ukraine's association status with the Digital Europe Programme and the conflict situation, (2) the HPC resource justification, while present, could more explicitly demonstrate why the requested compute exceeds playground access thresholds, (3) the budget allocation gives only 55% to the main participant (barely above the 50% threshold) and should be more explicitly justified, and (4) certain risks related to data access from a conflict zone and potential delays in EuroHPC resource allocation deserve more attention. Despite these concerns, this is a highly competitive proposal that, with minor refinements, should score well above the acceptance threshold of 10 points.",

      "feedback": "The proposal demonstrates outstanding conceptual and technical excellence. The gap analysis in Section 2 (State of the Art) is thorough and convincingly establishes that no existing model can address Ukrainian construction cost estimation—supported by specific evidence of >40% cost deviations from general-purpose LLMs. The three-tier architecture (domain-adapted LLM + hybrid RAG + evaluation framework) is technically sound and well-justified. The choice of Qwen-2.5-14B is supported by concrete benchmark scores and architectural advantages. The fine-tuning strategy (continued pre-training → SFT with LoRA → DPO alignment) follows established best practices with appropriate hyperparameter specifications. The evaluation framework is exemplary: six baselines (B1-B6) enabling clean ablation, quantitative metrics with specific targets, qualitative expert evaluation, and statistical significance testing. Performance metrics are clearly defined with ambitious but realistic targets (MAPE <8%, F1 >0.85, compliance >95%). The reproducibility plan (MLflow tracking, versioned code, checkpoint archiving) is comprehensive. Minor deductions: (1) The claim that 1,200 GPU-hours 'substantially exceeds' playground access is not strongly argued—the proposal notes playground access is 1,000-10,000 GPU-hours, placing the request at the lower end of this range rather than clearly exceeding it. (2) The secondary model candidate (Llama-3.1-13B) is mentioned for ablation but not deeply justified as a contingency if Qwen-2.5 proves problematic. (3) Some training estimates (e.g., 256 GPU-hours for continued pre-training on 280M tokens × 3 epochs for a 14B model) may be optimistic and should be validated with preliminary calculations."

      "feedback": "The impact narrative is one of the proposal's strongest elements. The innovation potential is clearly articulated across three dimensions (technical, market, and process innovation), and the commercial viability analysis is specific and credible: 12,000 Ukrainian construction SMEs as initial addressable market, €50-150/month SaaS pricing, €7-22M annual recurring revenue at maturity. The phased exploitation strategy (beta in Zaporizhzhia → national Ukraine → Eastern European expansion) is realistic. The societal relevance is compelling—directly linking to Ukraine's $500B+ reconstruction challenge and connecting to EU policy objectives around Ukraine's digital integration. The alignment with FFplus objectives is explicit and well-argued: the proposal directly demonstrates HPC business value for SMEs, contributes to European AI sovereignty, and supports SME digital transformation. The project creates a first-of-its-kind product category (construction estimation AI for non-English European languages), giving it strong innovation differentiation. The connection to the extension opportunity (top 70% eligibility) is strategically incorporated. Minor deductions: (1) Revenue projections in the exploitation roadmap could benefit from sensitivity analysis and more conservative scenarios. (2) The expansion to Moldova, Georgia, and Baltic states (Phase 3) assumes regulatory similarity that is asserted but not substantiated. (3) Letters of interest from 10 early adopter SMEs are planned but not yet secured—having even preliminary evidence of market demand would strengthen the proposal significantly."

      "feedback": "The work plan is well-structured with five clearly defined work packages, logical task sequencing, and appropriate milestones. The 10-month timeline is realistic with reasonable buffer time, and the critical path (data ready by M3 → model training M3-M7 → evaluation M7-M9) is achievable. The data management plan comprehensively addresses FAIR principles with specific technical implementations. Resource allocation across partners is logical: AI SME leads model development and evaluation, university lab leads RAG engineering and HPC infrastructure, construction SME provides data and domain validation. However, several implementation concerns warrant attention: (1) The budget allocates only 55% to the main participant, barely exceeding the 50% guideline—while the proposal justifies this implicitly through the work distribution, an explicit justification for the deviation is expected by the call text and is missing. (2) The capacity of the applicants is not sufficiently demonstrated—the proposal describes partner roles but provides no CVs, track records, prior publications, or specific evidence of existing expertise in generative AI, HPC, or construction estimation AI. Section 4 of the proposal template should contain this evidence per grant requirements. (3) P2 is described as a university laboratory, raising questions about whether it qualifies as a 'supporting participant' under the call rules (the call mentions SMEs and startups as main participants, with supporting participants that can be any organization, so this should be fine, but the nature of P2's involvement should be clarified). (4) The HPC resource justification states 1,200 GPU-hours but the call requires resources that 'clearly exceed' EuroHPC AI Factories playground access, which offers up to 10,000 GPU-hours—the proposal's request is actually within playground range, potentially undermining the large-scale HPC justification. (5) Travel costs are not mentioned or justified. (6) The contingency plan for EuroHPC access delays or denial is not addressed."

        "The societal impact narrative is powerful: direct connection to Ukraine's $500B+ reconstruction challenge, SME empowerment, workforce development, and public procurement transparency.",
        "Strong alignment with FFplus strategic objectives: HPC business value demonstration, European AI sovereignty, SME digital transformation, and Ukraine's digital integration.",
        "The sustainability argument (RAG supports continuous updates without retraining, SaaS revenue funds continued development) is convincing.",
        "Concern: The expansion to 'Moldova, Georgia, and Baltic states' in Phase 3 assumes regulatory framework similarity that should be substantiated. Baltic states (EU members) use different construction standards from post-Soviet DBN frameworks.",
        "Concern: The proposal positions Ukraine's EU integration and Digital Europe Programme association as strengths, but should acknowledge that the conflict situation creates uncertainty about market development timelines.",
        "The estimated commercial cloud equivalent cost (€35,000-60,000 = 12-20% of budget) effectively demonstrates why EuroHPC access is essential for SME-led AI development.",
        "Consider explicitly mentioning the potential for the model and methodology to be adapted for other European languages as part of broader EU impact—this would strengthen the pan-European relevance."
