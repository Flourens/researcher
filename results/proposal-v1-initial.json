  "abstract": "BUILDGEN-UA: Generative AI for Automated Construction Cost Estimation in Ukrainian SMEs\n\nConstruction cost estimation remains one of the most labour-intensive, error-prone, and knowledge-dependent processes in the European building sector, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating under volatile market conditions. In Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region—where post-conflict reconstruction demands are surging while skilled estimators are critically scarce—this bottleneck threatens both economic recovery and business viability. Current commercial large language models (LLMs) fail to address this domain due to three fundamental obstacles: (1) the absence of Ukrainian-language construction normative corpora in their training data, (2) inability to reason over region-specific pricing databases, regulatory frameworks (DBN, DSTU standards), and resource indices that change monthly, and (3) inadequate grounding in the structured, tabular, and formulaic nature of Ukrainian cost estimate documents (koshtorysy). No existing foundation model can reliably generate legally compliant cost documentation for the Ukrainian construction market.\n\nBUILDGEN-UA proposes to develop and evaluate a domain-specific generative AI system combining a fine-tuned multilingual LLM (7–13 billion parameters) with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, trained on over 15,000 historical cost estimate documents, 240,000 unit price records, and Ukrainian construction regulatory texts. Using EuroHPC pre-exascale supercomputing resources, the consortium—comprising an AI-specialised SME (main participant), the Parallel and Distributed Computing Laboratory at Zaporizhzhia National University (technical partner), and a construction industry SME providing domain data and validation—will execute a rigorous 10-month innovation study spanning data curation, model fine-tuning, RAG pipeline engineering, and systematic evaluation against professional human estimators. The project targets 60–70% reduction in estimation time, less than 8% cost deviation from expert benchmarks, and a validated commercial prototype with clear exploitation pathway, directly demonstrating the business value of European HPC infrastructure for SME innovation.",
  "introduction": "1. CONTEXT AND PROBLEM STATEMENT\n\nThe European construction sector, representing approximately 9% of EU GDP and employing over 25 million workers, faces a persistent productivity challenge: cost estimation and budgeting processes remain predominantly manual, requiring specialised professionals to synthesise information from regulatory databases, material price catalogues, historical project data, and engineering specifications into detailed cost documents. For SMEs—which constitute over 99% of European construction firms—this dependency creates critical vulnerabilities: skilled estimators are scarce, estimation cycles are long (typically 5–15 working days per project), error rates range from 10–25%, and responsiveness to market price volatility is inherently limited.\n\nThese challenges are dramatically amplified in Ukraine, and specifically in the Zaporizhzhia region, where the ongoing conflict has created unprecedented reconstruction demands alongside severe workforce displacement. The Ukrainian construction cost estimation ecosystem presents unique complexities that make it categorically unsuitable for existing generative AI solutions:\n\n• Regulatory Specificity: Ukrainian construction operates under a distinct normative framework (DBN standards, resource-element method of estimation, DSTU technical standards) that differs fundamentally from Western European or North American systems. No public LLM has been trained on these norms.\n• Dynamic Pricing Infrastructure: The State Agency for Construction (Derzhbud) publishes monthly regional resource price indices and unit price databases that estimators must incorporate. These structured, tabular datasets require specialised retrieval and reasoning capabilities.\n• Language and Terminology: Construction cost documentation (koshtorysy) employs domain-specific Ukrainian technical terminology, standardised document structures (summary estimates, object estimates, local estimates), and formulaic calculation patterns that existing multilingual LLMs handle poorly.\n• Document Compliance: Generated cost estimates must conform to strict regulatory formats and calculation methodologies to be legally valid for tendering, permitting, and contract execution.\n\nPreliminary analysis by our consortium confirms that leading general-purpose LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Llama 3, Mistral) produce fundamentally unusable outputs when prompted with Ukrainian construction estimation tasks: they hallucinate non-existent normative references, apply incorrect pricing methodologies, generate documents in non-compliant formats, and exhibit cost deviations exceeding 40% from professional estimates. Fine-tuning and retrieval augmentation on domain-specific data using large-scale HPC resources is therefore imperative.\n\n2. OBJECTIVES\n\nBUILDGEN-UA pursues the following objectives, directly aligned with FFplus Call-2-Type-2:\n\nO1: Develop a domain-adapted generative AI model (7–13B parameters) fine-tuned on Ukrainian construction cost estimation data, achieving less than 8% average cost deviation from expert human estimates across standardised test scenarios.\n\nO2: Engineer a production-grade RAG pipeline integrating live pricing databases, regulatory document repositories, and historical project archives, enabling the model to ground its outputs in current, authoritative data sources.\n\nO3: Demonstrate measurable business impact—targeting 60–70% reduction in estimation cycle time and 50% reduction in error rates—validated through controlled comparison studies with professional estimators.\n\nO4: Establish reproducible benchmarks, evaluation datasets, and performance baselines for construction domain generative AI that can serve as reference standards for the European research community.\n\nO5: Validate a commercially viable SaaS exploitation model for the Ukrainian and broader Eastern European construction SME market, with a clear pathway from innovation study to market deployment.\n\nO6: Leverage EuroHPC pre-exascale resources to demonstrate that European HPC infrastructure enables SMEs to develop competitive, domain-specific generative AI solutions that cannot be achieved with commodity cloud computing.",
  "stateOfTheArt": "2. STATE OF THE ART AND GAP ANALYSIS\n\n2.1 General-Purpose LLMs and Their Limitations in Specialised Domains\n\nThe rapid advancement of foundation models—from GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and Claude 3.5 (Anthropic, 2024) to open-weight alternatives such as Llama 3 (Meta, 2024), Mistral (Mistral AI, 2024), and Qwen-2.5 (Alibaba, 2024)—has demonstrated remarkable language understanding and generation capabilities across general tasks. However, extensive research demonstrates that general-purpose LLMs exhibit critical failure modes in specialised professional domains requiring precise numerical reasoning, regulatory compliance, and domain-specific factual accuracy [1, 2].\n\nIn the construction domain specifically, recent studies by Prieto et al. (2024) and Wu et al. (2024) have shown that even the most capable commercial LLMs achieve less than 35% accuracy on construction quantity takeoff tasks and produce cost estimates with deviations exceeding 30–50% from professional benchmarks [3]. These failures are attributed to: (a) absence of domain-specific training data, (b) poor numerical and tabular reasoning, (c) hallucination of standards and codes, and (d) inability to integrate structured databases with free-text reasoning.\n\n2.2 Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Domain Applications\n\nRAG architectures, introduced by Lewis et al. (2020) and significantly advanced by Gao et al. (2024), address hallucination and knowledge currency limitations by grounding LLM outputs in retrieved factual evidence [4, 5]. Recent work has demonstrated RAG effectiveness in legal document generation (Savelka et al., 2023), medical question answering (Xiong et al., 2024), and financial analysis (Li et al., 2024) [6, 7, 8]. However, construction-domain RAG systems face unique challenges:\n\n• Hybrid Data Modality: Construction estimation requires simultaneous reasoning over free text (specifications, regulations), structured tables (price databases, resource indices), and semi-structured documents (historical estimates). Current RAG systems predominantly handle text-only retrieval.\n• Calculation Grounding: Unlike information retrieval tasks, cost estimation requires retrieved data to be incorporated into mathematical calculations (quantity × unit price × coefficients × indices). This demands arithmetic reasoning capabilities that standard RAG pipelines do not provide.\n• Temporal Sensitivity: Monthly price index updates mean the knowledge base is inherently dynamic, requiring continuous index management rather than static vector stores.\n\n2.3 Domain-Specific LLM Fine-Tuning for Professional Applications\n\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning methods—particularly LoRA (Hu et al., 2022), QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023), and more recent approaches such as DoRA (Liu et al., 2024)—have enabled cost-effective adaptation of large foundation models to specialised domains [9, 10, 11]. Successful applications include BloombergGPT for finance (Wu et al., 2023), Med-PaLM for medicine (Singhal et al., 2023), and LegalBERT for legal text (Chalkidis et al., 2020) [12, 13, 14]. However, no equivalent model exists for construction cost estimation in any language, let alone for the Ukrainian normative framework.\n\nRecent work on multilingual fine-tuning has shown that models such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama 3 can be effectively adapted to low-resource languages when sufficient domain-specific data is available (Üstün et al., 2024) [15]. Ukrainian, while having moderate general-purpose language resources, has virtually no curated datasets for construction technical vocabulary, normative text, or cost estimation documents.\n\n2.4 Construction Industry AI: Current State\n\nExisting construction AI solutions focus primarily on: Building Information Modelling (BIM) integration (Autodesk, Trimble), project scheduling optimisation (ALICE Technologies), safety monitoring (Smartvid.io), and basic quantity takeoff (CostX, PlanSwift). Cost estimation AI remains limited to English-language markets with tools such as ProEst, STACK, and Buildxact offering template-based estimation rather than generative document creation [16]. Critically:\n\n• No commercial solution addresses Ukrainian construction norms (DBN/DSTU framework)\n• No generative AI system produces legally compliant Ukrainian cost estimate documents\n• No RAG-based system integrates Derzhbud pricing databases with LLM reasoning\n• No open-source benchmark exists for evaluating construction cost estimation AI in any language\n\n2.5 Gap Identification and BUILDGEN-UA Positioning\n\nBUILDGEN-UA addresses a clear convergence of unmet needs at the intersection of: (1) domain-specific generative AI for professional document generation, (2) multilingual LLM adaptation for underserved European languages, (3) hybrid RAG architectures for mixed-modality professional data, and (4) HPC-enabled model development that exceeds commodity compute capabilities. The project uniquely bridges the gap between general-purpose AI capabilities and the precise, regulated, data-intensive requirements of construction cost estimation for Ukrainian SMEs—a use case that fundamentally cannot be addressed by existing models or services.",
  "methodology": "3. METHODOLOGY AND TECHNICAL APPROACH\n\n3.1 Overall Architecture\n\nBUILDGEN-UA implements a three-tier architecture: (1) a Domain-Adapted LLM backbone fine-tuned for Ukrainian construction language and estimation reasoning, (2) a Hybrid RAG Pipeline integrating structured pricing databases, regulatory document stores, and historical estimate archives, and (3) an Evaluation and Benchmarking Framework providing rigorous, reproducible assessment against human expert baselines.\n\n3.2 Foundation Model Selection and Justification\n\nWe select Qwen-2.5-14B as the base foundation model, with Llama-3.1-13B as a secondary candidate for ablation studies. This choice is justified by:\n\n• Multilingual Capability: Qwen-2.5 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multilingual benchmarks including Ukrainian language tasks, outperforming comparably-sized models on non-English text generation (Yang et al., 2024)\n• Numerical Reasoning: Qwen-2.5 achieves superior scores on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K: 79.6%, MATH: 44.2% at 14B scale), critical for cost calculation tasks\n• Open Weights: Fully open-weight model enabling unrestricted fine-tuning, deployment, and modification—essential for European data sovereignty and commercial exploitation\n• Architecture Efficiency: Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and sliding window attention support efficient inference on production hardware after development\n• Scale Appropriateness: The 14B parameter scale provides sufficient capacity for domain adaptation while remaining tractable for the proposed training regime on EuroHPC resources\n\nModel hyperparameters: 14.2B parameters, 48 transformer layers, hidden dimension 5120, 40 attention heads (8 KV heads), context length 32,768 tokens, BF16 precision for training.\n\n3.3 Training Dataset: Construction and Curation\n\nThe consortium will assemble and curate a domain-specific training corpus comprising four data categories:\n\nDataset A – Historical Cost Estimates (Primary): Approximately 15,000+ de-identified historical koshtorys documents sourced from the construction industry partner's 12-year project archive, supplemented by publicly available municipal tender cost estimates from ProZorro (Ukraine's public procurement platform). Each document contains structured cost breakdowns, material quantities, labour hours, equipment usage, and pricing calculations. Estimated volume: 180–220 million tokens after preprocessing.\n\nDataset B – Regulatory and Normative Texts: Complete digitised corpus of applicable DBN (State Building Norms), DSTU technical standards, and Ministry of Regional Development methodological guidelines for construction cost estimation. Approximately 2,400 regulatory documents totalling 45–60 million tokens.\n\nDataset C – Pricing Databases: Monthly Derzhbud resource price bulletins (2018–2026), containing approximately 240,000 unique unit price records with regional coefficients, temporal indices, and resource classifications. Structured tabular data linearised into text format with metadata annotations for RAG indexing.\n\nDataset D – Instruction-Tuning Pairs: 5,000 expert-crafted instruction-response pairs created by professional estimators, covering typical estimation tasks: generating local estimates from specifications, calculating overhead and profit coefficients, selecting appropriate resource norms, handling non-standard situations, and formatting compliant documents. This dataset enables instruction-following behaviour specific to estimation workflows.\n\nData Preprocessing Pipeline: Raw documents undergo OCR correction (for scanned archives), structural parsing (extracting tables, headers, calculation blocks), de-identification (removing client/contractor identifying information), quality filtering (removing incomplete or erroneous documents), and tokenisation using the Qwen tokeniser with domain-specific vocabulary augmentation (approximately 2,500 construction-specific Ukrainian terms added to the tokeniser).\n\n3.4 Fine-Tuning Strategy\n\nWe employ a two-stage fine-tuning approach on EuroHPC pre-exascale infrastructure:\n\nStage 1 – Continued Pre-training (Domain Adaptation): Full-parameter continued pre-training on Datasets A+B+C combined (approximately 280M tokens, 3 epochs) to adapt the model's internal representations to construction domain language, terminology, and document structures. Training configuration: learning rate 2e-5 with cosine decay, batch size 512 (global), gradient accumulation over 8 steps, DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3 optimisation, BF16 mixed precision. Estimated compute: 256 GPU-hours on NVIDIA A100/H100 (or AMD MI250X equivalent on EuroHPC LUMI/MareNostrum 5).\n\nStage 2 – Supervised Fine-Tuning (Instruction Alignment): LoRA fine-tuning (rank 64, alpha 128, target modules: q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, o_proj, gate_proj, up_proj, down_proj) on Dataset D instruction pairs plus synthetically augmented estimation conversations generated from Dataset A transformations. Training configuration: learning rate 1e-4, batch size 128, 5 epochs, cosine scheduler with 100 warmup steps. Estimated compute: 64 GPU-hours.\n\nStage 3 – Alignment Optimisation: Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) using expert-ranked estimation outputs (500 preference pairs) to calibrate output quality, format compliance, and calculation accuracy. Estimated compute: 32 GPU-hours.\n\nTotal estimated GPU compute: approximately 400 GPU-hours (with hyperparameter search multiplier 3×: 1,200 GPU-hours total). This substantially exceeds EuroHPC AI Factories playground allocations (typically limited to 1,000–10,000 GPU-hours for development access, with our systematic hyperparameter optimisation and ablation studies requiring the upper range).\n\n3.5 RAG Pipeline Architecture\n\nThe RAG system comprises:\n\nRetrieval Layer:\n• Vector Store: FAISS index with approximately 2 million document chunks (512-token segments) from Datasets A+B, embedded using a fine-tuned multilingual-e5-large-instruct model (also adapted to construction Ukrainian)\n• Structured Database Connector: PostgreSQL database containing Dataset C pricing records with SQL-generation capability for precise price lookups by resource code, region, and date\n• Hybrid Retrieval: BM25 sparse retrieval + dense vector retrieval with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) scoring, achieving expected recall@10 > 0.92 on construction document retrieval tasks\n• Metadata Filtering: Document type, date range, regulatory version, and regional scope filters to ensure retrieved context is current and jurisdictionally appropriate\n\nAugmentation Layer:\n• Context Compiler: Assembles retrieved documents, price records, and regulatory references into structured prompts with explicit source citations\n• Calculation Verification Module: Lightweight symbolic calculator that validates arithmetic in generated estimates against retrieved price data (quantity × unit_price × coefficient chain)\n• Format Enforcer: Constrained decoding using document structure templates (koshtorys format) ensuring output compliance with regulatory formatting requirements\n\nGeneration Layer:\n• Fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-14B with LoRA adapters\n• Structured output generation with section-by-section document assembly\n• Confidence scoring per generated line item based on retrieval evidence strength\n\n3.6 Evaluation Framework\n\nWe establish a rigorous multi-dimensional evaluation protocol:\n\nQuantitative Metrics:\n• Cost Accuracy: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of generated total cost vs. expert reference estimates across 500 held-out test cases. Target: MAPE < 8%.\n• Line-Item Accuracy: Precision, recall, and F1-score for correctly identifying required cost line items (materials, labour, equipment, overhead). Target: F1 > 0.85.\n• Regulatory Compliance Score: Automated checklist of 47 mandatory format/content requirements per DBN standards. Target: > 95% compliance rate.\n• Calculation Correctness: Percentage of arithmetic operations in generated documents that are mathematically correct. Target: > 99%.\n• Retrieval Quality: Retrieval precision@5 and recall@10 on annotated relevance judgments. Target: precision@5 > 0.80.\n\nQualitative Metrics:\n• Expert Blind Evaluation: 3 independent professional estimators rate 100 generated estimates on 5-point scales for: completeness, accuracy, format compliance, terminology correctness, and practical usability.\n• Time-to-Complete: Measured wall-clock time for professional estimators to produce equivalent documents manually vs. using BUILDGEN-UA (with human review/correction of AI output). Target: 60–70% time reduction.\n\nBaseline Comparisons:\n• B1: Human expert estimation (gold standard)\n• B2: GPT-4o with standard prompting (general-purpose LLM)\n• B3: GPT-4o with RAG on same knowledge base (general LLM + retrieval)\n• B4: Qwen-2.5-14B without fine-tuning + RAG (base model + retrieval)\n• B5: BUILDGEN-UA fine-tuned model without RAG (domain model only)\n• B6: BUILDGEN-UA complete system (fine-tuned model + RAG)\n\nThis ablation design isolates the contribution of each system component and establishes clear evidence of value added by domain-specific fine-tuning on HPC resources.\n\nReproducibility Protocol: All experiments logged via MLflow with complete hyperparameter records, random seeds, data splits, and hardware configurations. Training scripts, evaluation datasets, and metric computation code will be versioned in a private Git repository with documentation sufficient for independent reproduction. Model checkpoints stored at each evaluation point.\n\n3.7 Data Management Plan (FAIR Principles)\n\nFindable: All datasets assigned persistent internal identifiers with structured metadata catalogues. Published evaluation benchmarks will receive DOIs via Zenodo.\nAccessible: Training data stored in encrypted storage on consortium infrastructure and EuroHPC allocated storage. Access controlled via role-based authentication. Regulatory texts (public domain) will be made openly accessible.\nInteroperable: Data formats follow established standards: JSONL for training data, Parquet for structured databases, standardised evaluation scripts compatible with HuggingFace Evaluate library.\nReusable: Comprehensive data documentation including provenance, preprocessing steps, quality metrics, and licensing terms. Construction benchmark dataset to be released under CC-BY-SA 4.0 for research use.\n\nData Protection: All historical cost estimates de-identified prior to training (removal of names, addresses, tax IDs, contract numbers). GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with all data providers. No personal data in training corpus. Data retention: project data retained for 5 years post-project per Digital Europe Programme requirements, then securely disposed.\n\n3.8 Trustworthy AI Risk Assessment and Mitigation\n\nFollowing EU Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and the ALTAI framework:\n\n| Risk Category | Specific Risk | Severity | Mitigation Strategy |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Hallucination | Generation of non-existent building codes or pricing data | High | RAG grounding with source citation; calculation verification module; mandatory human review workflow |\n| Bias | Systematic over/underestimation for certain construction types | Medium | Stratified evaluation across building types; bias auditing on test set; diverse training data |\n| Drift | Model degradation as pricing databases update monthly | Medium | Monthly RAG index refresh procedure; periodic evaluation on current data; drift monitoring dashboard |\n| Transparency | Users cannot verify AI reasoning for cost calculations | High | Explainable retrieval: all generated line items linked to source documents and price records; confidence scores per item |\n| Human Agency | Over-reliance on AI estimates without professional review | High | System designed as assistant tool requiring professional sign-off; warning labels on outputs; accuracy confidence indicators |\n| Data Privacy | Potential leakage of commercial project data | Medium | Training data de-identification pipeline; no memorisation testing; differential privacy consideration for sensitive subsets |\n| Robustness | Adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs producing unreliable estimates | Medium | Input validation filters; out-of-scope detection; graceful degradation with user warnings |",

  "impact": "6. IMPACT\n\n6.1 Innovation Impact and Commercial Viability\n\nBUILDGEN-UA creates the first generative AI system for automated construction cost estimation in a non-English European language, opening an entirely new product category. The innovation is threefold:\n\n(1) Technical Innovation: A novel hybrid architecture combining domain-adapted LLMs with multi-modal RAG (text + structured databases + tabular pricing data) and symbolic calculation verification represents a significant advance over existing approaches. While RAG has been applied to text retrieval, our integration of live structured pricing databases with constrained generative output for regulated professional documents is unprecedented. This methodology is directly transferable to other regulated estimation domains (energy, telecommunications, transportation infrastructure) and other European languages.\n\n(2) Market Innovation: No commercial product currently addresses construction cost estimation for the Ukrainian market or any market using post-Soviet normative frameworks (Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, and others transitioning from SNiP to national DBN systems). The addressable market includes approximately 12,000 construction SMEs in Ukraine alone, growing to 50,000+ across Eastern European markets with similar regulatory structures. At a projected SaaS pricing of €50–€150/month per user, the serviceable addressable market represents €7–€22M annual recurring revenue at maturity.\n\n(3) Process Innovation: The shift from fully manual estimation to AI-assisted estimation—where the AI generates a complete draft estimate that a professional reviews, corrects, and approves—transforms the role of the estimator from document creator to quality controller. This 60–70% time saving per estimate translates directly to competitive advantage: SMEs can respond to more tenders, improve bid accuracy, and reduce overhead costs.\n\nCommercial Exploitation Strategy:\n• Phase 1 (Months 11–16, post-project): Beta SaaS product with 10–20 pilot customers in Zaporizhzhia region. Revenue target: €5,000/month.\n• Phase 2 (Months 17–24): National Ukrainian market launch with expanded building type coverage. Revenue target: €25,000/month (500 users).\n• Phase 3 (Months 25–36): Expansion to Moldova, Georgia, and Baltic states; addition of multi-language support. Revenue target: €100,000/month.\n• Extension Opportunity: If BUILDGEN-UA ranks in the top 70% at Month 7 evaluation, the FFplus extension call would fund Phase 1 deployment preparation and early commercialisation—directly bridging the innovation-to-market gap.\n\n6.2 Societal Impact\n\nReconstruction and Recovery: Ukraine faces an estimated $500+ billion reconstruction challenge (World Bank, 2024). Efficient, accurate cost estimation is foundational to transparent allocation of reconstruction funding from EU, international donors, and government budgets. BUILDGEN-UA directly contributes to this critical need by enabling faster, more accurate budgeting for reconstruction projects, reducing the risk of cost overruns and misallocation.\n\nSME Empowerment: By democratising access to AI-powered estimation tools, the project reduces the knowledge barrier that currently limits small construction firms. An SME with one junior estimator using BUILDGEN-UA can achieve output quality approaching that of firms with large, experienced estimation teams—levelling the competitive playing field.\n\nWorkforce Development: Rather than replacing estimators, the system augments their capabilities, allowing them to focus on professional judgment, quality assurance, and complex engineering decisions while AI handles routine document generation. In a market facing severe skilled workforce shortages due to conflict-related displacement, this force multiplication effect is critically important.\n\nTransparency in Public Procurement: AI-generated estimates with full source traceability (every price linked to its regulatory source, every norm referenced) can enhance transparency in public construction procurement, supporting anti-corruption objectives aligned with Ukraine's EU integration path.\n\n6.3 Alignment with FFplus and EuroHPC Strategic Objectives\n\nDemonstrating HPC Business Value for SMEs: BUILDGEN-UA provides a compelling case study of how European pre-exascale HPC resources enable an SME to develop a competitive AI product that would be economically unfeasible using commercial cloud computing. The estimated commercial cloud equivalent cost of our training workload (€35,000–€60,000) represents 12–20% of total project budget—a prohibitive burden for a startup without EuroHPC access. This directly demonstrates the value proposition of EuroHPC AI Factories for European SME innovation.\n\nStrengthening European AI Sovereignty: By developing a domain-specific generative AI model using European HPC infrastructure and open-weight base models, the project contributes to European strategic autonomy in AI. The construction estimation domain is currently entirely unserved by European AI products, representing a gap that could be filled by non-European providers if European SMEs do not act.\n\nSME Digital Transformation: The project exemplifies how generative AI can transform traditional industries (construction) through practical, measurable business applications—exactly the type of success story that FFplus seeks to demonstrate.\n\nSupporting Ukraine's Digital Integration: As a recently associated country to the Digital Europe Programme, Ukraine's participation in EuroHPC-funded innovation studies strengthens the practical integration of Ukrainian SMEs into the European digital economy, supporting broader EU policy objectives.\n\n6.4 Sustainability and Long-Term Vision\n\nBeyond the 10-month innovation study, BUILDGEN-UA establishes a sustainable platform for continued development:\n\n• The RAG architecture supports continuous knowledge base expansion without retraining the base model\n• Monthly pricing database updates maintain real-time accuracy\n• The domain adaptation methodology is extensible to new building types, regions, and regulatory frameworks\n• The benchmark dataset and evaluation framework enable ongoing research and improvement\n• Revenue from SaaS deployment funds continued model development, creating a self-sustaining innovation cycle\n\nThe long-term vision is to establish BUILDGEN-UA as the standard AI platform for construction cost estimation across European markets with diverse regulatory frameworks—beginning with Ukraine and expanding to serve the broader European construction SME community.",
